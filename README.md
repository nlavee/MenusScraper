I made this because I wanted to know what is being served on a specific day at Skidmore College. Sometimes, the food being served might be something I particularly like, or know that it'll cause chaos in Dhall. Made for fun, because why not?

##HOW TO RUN##  
The current process is to run DhallScraper.sh, which will also runs ScrapeDhall.pl.  

##NOTE##  
If DhallScraper fails to run, it might be because of lack of dependencies.   
Try the following line and then re-run DhallScraper.sh.  
```
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```
